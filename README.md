# io_scene_sth_mtn

This plugin for Blender 3D allows you to import and export animations (`.mtn` or `.STHanim`) for Shadow the Hedgehog. Based on [Shadow-the-Hedgehog-.BON-MTN-import-export-tool](https://github.com/Shadowth117/Shadow-the-Hedgehog-.BON-MTN-import-export-tool).

Poorly tested and made just for fun. Keyframes are created on empty objects that transform the pose bones (it is not comfortable).

## How to import animation
1. Import DFF model into Blender
2. Make armature active
3. Import BON skeleton
4. Make _bon_root_ object active
5. Imort MTN animation

## Requirements

* Blender 3D (2.81 and higher)
* [DragonFF](https://github.com/Parik27/DragonFF)
